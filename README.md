# Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography  

## 🔒 Introduction  
With the increasing dependence on digital communication, protecting sensitive information has become crucial. This project implements **LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography** to embed secret messages within images, ensuring secure and undetectable data transmission.  

## ✨ Features  
- **Secure Message Concealment** – Uses LSB encoding to hide messages inside images without visibly altering them.  
- **Passcode Protection** – Only authorized users can retrieve the hidden message.  
- **Lightweight Execution** – No NumPy dependency, making it compact and efficient.  
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.  
- **No Size Restriction** – Large messages can be embedded in high-resolution images.  

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. The user selects an image to serve as a cover.  
2. A secret message is embedded within the image using LSB steganography.  
3. The modified image is saved, appearing unchanged to the human eye.  
4. The recipient extracts the hidden message using the decoding function.  

## 🎯 Use Cases  
- **Journalists & Whistleblowers** – Securely communicate sensitive information.  
- **Cybersecurity Enthusiasts** – Learn and implement steganographic techniques.  
- **Researchers & Developers** – Enhance secure data transmission and cryptographic research.  
- **Everyday Users** – Send private messages without detection.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- 🔹 **Support for Audio & Video Steganography** – Extending the project to embed data in audio/video files.  
- 🔹 **GUI-Based Implementation** – Creating a user-friendly interface for non-technical users.  
- 🔹 **AI-based Image Optimization** – Ensuring that encrypted images remain indistinguishable even under analysis.  
- 🔹 **Multi-layered Security** – Implementing AES encryption alongside steganography for added protection.  
- 🔹 **Mobile App Version** – Developing an Android/iOS application for on-the-go usage.
