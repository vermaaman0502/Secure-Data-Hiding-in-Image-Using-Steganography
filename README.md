# Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Image-Using-Steganography
Overview
This project provides a secure and efficient method for concealing sensitive messages within images using Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography. By embedding data within image pixels, this technique enables discreet communication while maintaining the image's visual integrity.

Features
âœ… Secure Message Embedding â€“ Uses LSB encoding to hide text inside images without noticeable changes.
âœ… Passcode Protection â€“ Ensures only authorized users can retrieve hidden messages.
âœ… Lightweight & Efficient â€“ No heavy dependencies like NumPy, making it compact and fast.
âœ… Cross-Platform Support â€“ Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
âœ… High Capacity â€“ Large messages can be concealed in high-resolution images.

Use Cases
ðŸ”¹ Journalists & Whistleblowers â€“ Securely communicate sensitive information without detection.
ðŸ”¹ Cybersecurity Enthusiasts â€“ Learn and implement steganographic techniques for research.
ðŸ”¹ Researchers & Developers â€“ Enhance secure data transmission and cryptographic studies.
ðŸ”¹ Everyday Users â€“ Privately share confidential messages without drawing attention.

Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/vermaaman0502/Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Image-Using-Steganography.git
cd Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Image-Using-Steganography
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Hiding a Message
Run the script and provide an image along with your secret message:

bash
Copy
Edit
python hide.py --input image.png --message "Your Secret Message" --output hidden.png
Extracting a Message
To retrieve the hidden message from an image:

bash
Copy
Edit
python extract.py --input hidden.png
Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Audio & Video Steganography â€“ Extending support to embed messages in audio and video files.
ðŸ”¹ Graphical User Interface (GUI) â€“ Making the tool user-friendly for non-technical users.
ðŸ”¹ AI-Based Image Optimization â€“ Ensuring hidden data remains undetectable even under analysis.
ðŸ”¹ AES Encryption â€“ Adding an extra security layer to protect embedded messages.
ðŸ”¹ Mobile Application â€“ Developing an Android/iOS version for secure on-the-go usage.
